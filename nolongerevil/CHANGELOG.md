# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - Mar 31, 2026

### Network Scanner and Device Credentials

Added local network scanning to discover and configure Nest devices from the dashboard, and surface each device's `api_key` for local API access.

### Added

- **Network Scanner**: scan your local /24 subnet from the dashboard to discover unconfigured Nest devices and automatically configure them to your HA add-on in one click
- **Device Credentials**: each thermostat's `api_key` is now captured from Basic Auth on first connection and displayed in the dashboard, making local API configuration straightforward
- **`require_device_pairing` option**: control whether devices must complete entry key pairing before transport access (default: false)
- **`panel_title` config**: customizable ingress panel title ("NLE Thermostats")

## [0.1.0] - Dec 11, 2025

### Frontend Consolidation

Migrated backend server from Node.js/TypeScript to Python for improved maintainability and performance.
Eliminated the Node.js frontend entirely by consolidating all functionality into the Python server.

### Changed

- Web UI now served directly from Python server on port 8082
- Removed Node.js/npm from Docker image
- MQTT and user initialization moved to Python server startup

### Removed

- Entire `frontend/` directory
- Node.js runtime dependency

### Added

- Health check endpoint at `/health`

### Technical Details

- Web UI served via aiohttp from `routes/control/templates/index.html`
- Ingress path injected via `data-ingress-path` attribute on body tag

## [0.0.7] - Dec 6, 2025

### Device Availability Tracking and MQTT State Management Improvements

## Overview

Implements device availability tracking via watchdog, fixes MQTT fan mode handling, and corrects HVAC state reporting for Home Assistant integration.

### Device Availability Watchdog

**New `DeviceAvailabilityWatchdog` service:**

- Tracks device connectivity via `/entry` endpoints, PUT requests, and active SUBSCRIBE connections
- 5-minute timeout (300s) with 30-second check interval
- All devices start as unavailable until first activity
- Integrates with `IntegrationManager` to notify integrations of availability changes
- Monitors active long-polling subscriptions via `SubscriptionManager.getActiveSerials()`

### MQTT Integration Fixes

#### Fan Mode State Management

**Problem:** Fan mode was reverting in HA UI due to race conditions between MQTT commands and thermostat SUBSCRIBE responses.

- Atomic multi-field updates via new `updateDeviceFields()` method
- Immediate state republish after command execution (`publishHomeAssistantState()`)
- Created `deriveFanMode()` helper that prioritizes commanded state over physical state
- Fan on: sets `fan_control_state=true`, `fan_timer_active=true`, `fan_timer_timeout=(now+3600s)`
- Fan off: sets all three fields to false/0

#### HVAC Action & State Reporting

**Fixed incorrect state field lookups:**

- HVAC hardware state (`hvac_heater_state`, `hvac_ac_state`, `hvac_fan_state`) moved from `device.{serial}` to correct location in `shared.{serial}`
- Updated `deriveHvacAction()`, `isHeatingActive()`, `isCoolingActive()` helpers
- Added detailed logging for HVAC action and fan mode derivation

#### Home Assistant Discovery

**Dynamic temperature topic configuration:**

- `heat_cool` mode: only publishes `temperature_high` and `temperature_low` topics
- `heat`/`cool`/`off` modes: only publishes single `temperature` topic
- Discovery now republished on every state update to ensure config matches current mode
- Prevents HA errors when switching between single-setpoint and range modes

### Fan Timer Preservation Logic

**Enhanced `fanTimer.ts` to handle explicit fan-off commands:**

- New `isExplicitlyTurningOffFan()` check prevents preservation when device sends `fan_timer_timeout: 0` or `fan_control_state: false`
- Preservation logic now takes incoming values into account, not just existing state
- Fixes issue where thermostat's manual fan-off was being overridden by stale server state

### Subscription Management

**Removed automatic subscription timeout:**

- `SUBSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT_MS` now defaults to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` (disabled)
- Allows thermostat to maintain long-polling connections indefinitely
- Prevents server from prematurely closing connections and forcing thermostat into PUT-only mode
- Enhanced logging with timestamps for subscription lifecycle events

### Upload Route

**Fixed log directory creation:**

- `handleUpload()` now ensures `DEBUG_LOGS_DIR` exists before writing
- Allows upload logs to work even when `DEBUG_LOGGING=false`

## [0.0.6] - 2025

### Added

- Device deletion from web UI
- DELETE /api/devices/:serial endpoint for removing device ownership
- Automatic Home Assistant discovery cleanup when device is deleted

## [0.0.5] - 2025

### Changed

- Repository restructured for Home Assistant add-on store compatibility
- Add-on moved to `nolongerevil/` subdirectory for proper repository format
- Improved CI/CD pipeline with multi-architecture builds (amd64, aarch64)

- Removed `hassio_role` config (uses default value)
- Added Home Assistant add-on linter to CI
- Updated documentation with installation badges and quick-install button
- Added `url` and `panel_icon` to config

### Added
